#2 Next, establish the starting state of the game, i.e. the empty board.
#Create a new board by setting a variable board equal to instantiating
#a new array with 9 elements, each of which is a blank space, " ".
board = [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
#3 Now, ask the user for input by outputting "Where would you like to go?"
#to the terminal.
puts "Where woud you like to go?"

#4 We need to store the user's input. Use gets.strip to store
#their input to a variable, input.
input = gets.strip
#4 Now we want to convert the user's input to an array index using our
#input_to_index method and store this as the variable index.
input_to_index(input)

#5 Now we're ready to call our #move method.
#Do so with the arguments of the board, the index the user wants to access
#and the default player of "X".
move(board, 0, "X")
#6 Lastly, display the board by calling the #display_board method,
#passing in the necessary arguments required to run this method.
display_board(board)
